	},

		id: "tailwind-version",
		label: "Tailwind version",
		q: "Which Tailwind version is required?",
		a: "Tailwind CSS v4. The token system uses @theme and @custom-variant, both v4-only features.",

		id: "react-version",
		label: "React 18 support",
		q: "Does it work with React 18?",
		a: "Everything ships targeting React 19. Most components work on 18 (ref-as-prop is the main v19-only affordance), but no guarantee — we don't test against 18.",
	},

		id: "license",

		id: "ship-a-new-component",
		label: "Propose a component",
		q: "How do I propose a new component?",
		a: "Open a discussion on GitHub with the use case. If it's broadly applicable and distinct from what's already shipped, we'll add it to the registry and publish a schema.",
	},
	{
		id: "contrib",
		label: "Theme contributions",
