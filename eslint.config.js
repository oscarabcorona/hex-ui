// FLAT CONFIG REPLACES, IT DOES NOT MERGE. Two blocks that both set

// selectors — the earlier ones are silently disarmed, with no warning and no
// failing test. This is not hypothetical: the colour fence below shipped
// scoped to the component layers while a later unscoped block re-declared the
// rule, so a `#ff00aa` in `primitives/button/button.tsx` linted clean for the
// whole life of the rule.
//
// So the selectors live in named constants and every block that narrows a
// file set REPEATS what it inherits. If you add a block that sets
// `no-restricted-syntax`, spread `BASE_SYNTAX` into it.
