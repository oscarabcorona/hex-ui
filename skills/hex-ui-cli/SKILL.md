# Hex UI — CLI

The `hex` binary is provided by `@hex-core/cli`. Install via `pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli <cmd>` or `pnpm add -g @hex-core/cli`.

## Commands

### `hex init [--theme <name>]`

Writes `hex.config.json` at the project root with sensible defaults. Run once per project. Theme default is `default`; other options: `midnight`, `ember`.

### `hex add <slug> [...slugs] [flags]`

Copies component source into `components/ui/<slug>.tsx`, writes shared `lib/utils.ts` if missing, prints the npm peer-deps command.

- `--overwrite` / `-o`: replace existing files (default: skip)
- `--yes` / `-y`: no interactive prompts
- `--no-deps`: do **not** install internal component dependencies. Default behavior is transitive: `hex add combobox` also installs `command` and `popover` (and their own deps). Use `--no-deps` when you want to review what would be installed.

### `hex list`

Prints every component in the registry grouped by category. Read-only; safe to run any time.

### `hex recipe list`

Prints every recipe (slug, title, summary, component list).

### `hex recipe add <slug> [flags]`

Installs every component in the recipe's step list (transitively), then prints the post-install checklist as plain markdown. Same `--overwrite` / `--yes` flags as `hex add`. Always installs deps.

Recipes: `auth-form`, `settings-page`, `pricing-table`, `data-table-view`, `confirm-destructive`, `command-palette`.

### `hex skills install [--target <path>] [--overwrite]`

Copies the 8 skills that ship with hex-ui into `<cwd>/.claude/skills/` by default. An agent reading the host repo will then load them into context as needed.

## Canonical flows

**Fresh project setup:**
```bash
pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli init
pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli add button input label
pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli skills install  # once per repo, for agent tooling
```

**Build a feature via recipe:**
```bash
pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli recipe add settings-page
# → installs 8 components + prints ~30-item checklist
```

**Dry-run review (no transitive install):**
```bash
pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli add combobox --no-deps
# → writes only combobox.tsx + warning about missing command/popover
```

## Common mistakes

- **Running `hex add` outside a project root.** The CLI writes into `cwd`. If you're in a parent directory, files land in the wrong place.
- **Forgetting `--overwrite` when you want to reset a customized component.** Default is skip. The CLI never clobbers by accident.
- **Running `hex recipe add` twice and wondering why nothing changed.** That's skip-if-exists at work. Add `--overwrite` or delete the files first.
- **Expecting `hex add combobox --no-deps` to just fail.** It warns, doesn't fail. Exit code is 0. Parse the stderr or follow the printed "Install: hex add ..." line.
- **Running the CLI before running `hex init`.** `hex init` is optional — `hex add` works without it. But the config file is where you'd edit the target components dir if you don't want `components/ui/`.
