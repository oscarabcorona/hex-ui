/**
 * Resolver regression assertions. Runs as a standalone node script via
 * `pnpm -F \@hex-ui/mcp test:resolver`. Lightweight — no test runner
 * dependency — because the resolver is a pure function and a broken
 * scoring rule should fail loudly in a single file.
 *
 * Add a new case by appending to `CASES`. Each case fixes the expected
 * ranking for a brief; any future scoring change must either re-justify
 * the brief or update the case deliberately.
 *
 * All output (success AND failure) writes to stderr. Exit code is the
 * machine-readable contract: 0 = pass, 1 = fail. Stdout is left empty
 * so piping this into another command stays clean.
