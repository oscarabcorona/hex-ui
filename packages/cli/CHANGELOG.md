# @hex-core/cli

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- c7d4ffb: React Native target (Theme K): a new `@hex-core/native` package, plus the substrate that lets one catalog serve two renderers.

  **`@hex-core/native`** — 26 components for Expo and React Native, built on NativeWind and `@rn-primitives`. Twelve primitives (Text, Button, Card, Badge, Avatar, Separator, Label, Input, Checkbox, Switch, Progress, Skeleton), eight overlays and form controls (Tabs, RadioGroup, Textarea, Dialog, AlertDialog, Popover, Tooltip, Select), a native-only BottomSheet, and five AI Kit components (Message, MessageList, Composer, ToolCall, Markdown). Every one carries the same machine-readable `ai` block as its web counterpart, so an agent gets the same guidance on either platform.

  The Markdown component is a real native renderer, not a wrapper: it shares the micromark parser the web component uses and replaces only the render step, walking an mdast tree into `Text` and `View`. Partial markup — an unterminated `**`, a half-typed fence, a dangling `[link](` — parses as literal text, so a streaming reply can be re-rendered on every token.

  **`@hex-core/registry`** — new `platform` field (`"web" | "native"`) on the component, item and index schemas, and `deriveNativeSchema()`, which builds a native schema from a web one plus an explicit diff. `accessibilityNotes`, `commonMistakes`, `examples` and `dependencies` are mandatory overrides rather than inherited, because that is where DOM assumptions hide. The field is optional on the authoring type and omitted from emitted JSON when it is `"web"`, so the existing catalog is byte-identical.

  **`@hex-core/tokens`** — `generateGlobalsCssNative()` and `themeToNativeTheme()`. Both resolve palette references to literal HSL triplets: React Native has no cascade for a `var()` chain to resolve through.

  **`@hex-core/cli`** — `hex init` and `hex add` learn `--platform`, and detect Expo, Expo Router and bare React Native projects on their own. On a native project `hex add button` installs `native-button`, and installing a component built for the other renderer is refused rather than silently copied. `hex init --platform native` writes the NativeWind config chain and the token stylesheet.

  **`@hex-core/mcp`** — `search_components` takes an optional `platform` filter and reports each item's platform. The enumeration ceiling rises from 200 to 500, because the catalog passed 200 items and a ceiling below the item count turns full enumeration into a silently partial one.

  **`@hex-core/payload`** — re-exports `resolveInternalDepForPlatform`, and `buildAppContext` now uses it. Internal dependencies name a source path (`primitives/text/text`) that is identical in a native item and a web one, so resolving it without the declaring item's platform sent a reader of a native Card to the React DOM `Text`. `AppContextInput` gains an optional `itemExists` predicate for the catalog to resolve against; it defaults to accepting every name, which leaves web payloads byte-identical. `KNOWN_NPM_VERSIONS` also gains pins for the native dependency set so `hex poc` stays off `latest` on that path too.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- c2ce968: `hex poc` and MCP `scaffold_poc` now produce an app that demos itself: one floating panel switching role (`viewer` / `member` / `admin`) and data state (with data / empty), both held in cookies so a selection survives clicking through the frames.

  The generated `app/globals.css` also scopes Tailwind's content scan to the app's own directories. A POC is normally scaffolded inside an existing repository, where Tailwind's automatic detection walked up to the enclosing git root and read binary files as class candidates — every route 500'd with unparseable CSS until the scan was scoped.

  Both changes arrive through the vendored payload builder, so no CLI or MCP code changed — but the generated output did. `scaffold_poc` responses grow roughly 36% (the harness plus the `empty` and `select` sources every tree now copies).

- c2ce968: Ship every file a component actually imports.

  Thirty registry items were emitted with imports pointing at files that were
  never written beside them: `hex add auth-sign-in-split` produced a component
  importing six others that did not exist, and `markdown` was missing five.
  The file collector only followed same-directory siblings, `*-variants` and
  `_shared`, so a cross-directory import fell straight through.

  The collector now walks the import graph transitively — pulling in
  `button.tsx` also pulls in the `button-variants.tsx` it imports — and
  recognises two more shapes: cross-directory component imports
  (`../<name>/<name>`) and category-level shared modules (`../types`).
  `rewriteRegistryImports` gains the matching rule for the latter, so
  `../types.js` resolves to `@/components/ui/types` rather than pointing one
  directory above where the file lands.

  Across all 187 items, every relative import in an emitted file now resolves
  to a file that item ships. Thirty items gained 84 previously-missing files.

### Patch Changes

- c2ce968: Resolve `var()` indirection when parsing a `globals.css`.

  `hex theme edit -i` annotates each token with its AA contrast, which needs
  the colour rather than a pointer to it. A palette-backed theme writes
  `--primary: var(--slate-900)` and puts the triplet on the ramp entry, so the
  parser now follows the reference. Files that declare literals throughout are
  unaffected.

- c2ce968: `hex poc` now scaffolds app-shaped page recipes that compile. `hex poc --recipe app-page` previously emitted a route with an undefined `DataTable`, failing `next build`; screens composing `timeline`, `data-table`, `input-otp`, `stepper` or `canvas` were skipped or broken. The CLI picks this up through its vendored registry, so no CLI code changed — but the user-visible behaviour did.
- 0284051: Stop shipping whole graph nodes over the MCP wire.

  `query_graph explain button` cost 16,429 tokens — 8 % of a 200K context for
  one call — because each neighbour embedded the entire far-end graph node,
  `exports` and `exportPaths` included, plus an edge whose `source`/`target`
  merely restated the two slugs already present. Neighbours are now projected
  to the six fields a caller acts on: 3,181 tokens, and every hub drops 73–81 %.
  `neighbors` mode returns `{total, neighbors}` so a capped result says it was
  capped.

  `search_components` was unbounded. Called with no arguments — how an agent
  enumerates the catalog — it returned all 187 summaries at 24,018 tokens. It
  now pages at 20 and returns `{total, returned, results}`; pass `limit` (max 200) for more. Its matcher also treated the query as a substring, so `"and"`
  matched `command`; it now matches word prefixes, so `"butt"` still finds
  `button` and `"and"` does not.

  Both surfaces, plus `search_compositions`, `resolve_spec` and
  `map_application`, now have token ceilings in the contract test. None of them
  had one before, which is why neither cost was noticed.

  `resolveSpec` read the full item JSON for every candidate scoring above zero —
  133 of 187 items for a ten-token brief — before slicing to eight. The read
  moved past the slice; output is unchanged. `loadRecipes`, `listThemes` and the
  POC export index are memoised, and `hex add` no longer re-reads the same item
  from three call sites.

  `@hex-core/payload` gains a `wordSet` export (the matcher `search_components`
  now shares) and a named `ThemeSummary` type for `listThemes`.

### Minor Changes

- 33440ea: Agent-builder commands: `hex map` (deterministic brief → screens/install/warnings map, `--out hex.map.json`), `hex poc` (scaffold a standalone runnable Next.js demo app from a brief, map, or page recipe), and `hex graph explain|affected|neighbors|path` (query the shipped catalog knowledge graph; mirrors MCP `query_graph`'s four modes). `hex add --from` now also accepts a `hex.map.json` application map; `hex doctor` verifies the bundled catalog graph.

  Note: the CLI now depends on `@hex-core/payload`, which vendors its own copy of the registry. An `npx @hex-core/cli` install therefore carries two registry snapshots (~2x unpacked size). This is a deliberate trade for a single shared engine across CLI and MCP — the CLI injects its own snapshot into every payload entry point, so the two can never skew.

### Minor Changes

- b28f8ee: feat(recipes): page-recipe system foundation

  Recipes can now describe whole pages, not just component bundles. A recipe
  gains an optional `kind` (`component` — the default and every existing recipe,
  or `page`), plus page-only fields: `pageType` (`landing` | `app` | `ecommerce`),
  a recommended `theme` (token preset + whole-page token budget), an ordered
  `sections` list (each a section block with an `intent`), and a `layout` brief.
  - `build-registry` validates section blocks against the catalog and derives
    checklist items from their `ai` metadata, same as component steps.
  - MCP `get_recipe` returns the full page spec in one call; `list_recipes`
    surfaces `kind`/`pageType` so an LLM can find the page recipe for a request.
  - CLI `hex recipe add <page>` installs the section blocks in order and surfaces
    the recommended theme + layout. `hex recipe list` tags page recipes.

  Fully backward-compatible — every existing recipe still validates and installs
  unchanged.

- b28f8ee: refactor(recipes)!: rename the `app-shell` recipe to `layout-starter`

  The new `app-shell` **block** (an application layout frame) takes the canonical
  `app-shell` slug, so the legacy `app-shell` **recipe** — which is really a bundle
  of twelve layout primitives — is renamed to `layout-starter`. This keeps slug
  discovery (CLI `hex add` / `hex recipe add` and MCP `get_component` /
  `get_recipe`) unambiguous: "app shell" now resolves to the component an agent
  expects, and the primitives bundle reads as what it is.

  Breaking: `hex recipe add app-shell` is now `hex recipe add layout-starter`.

### Minor Changes

- 71ba05c: feat(cli): close 6 AI-onboarding gaps from real-session feedback

  Wires Hex Core discovery into the touchpoints AI agents actually hit:
  `hex init`, `hex add`, `hex doctor`, and `hex skills`.

  **`hex add` nudges**
  - New `--pack layout` shortcut installs `container` + `stack` + `cluster` + `grid` + `spacer` + `empty` in one call.
  - "Related primitives you might want next" line — driven by each schema's `ai.relatedComponents`, validated against `registry/items/` so a schema typo can't reach the user as a `hex add stacks` recommendation. Capped at 8 with a `(+N more)` indicator when truncated.
  - "You added N primitives but no layout primitives" nudge when ≥3 interactive primitives install without any layout primitive on disk.

  **`hex doctor --layout`**

  Two new info-only scans on the consumer's source tree:
  - **Installed-but-unused** — `<Card>` is in `components/ui/` but no source file renders it, suggesting the agent rolled raw `<div>`s instead of composing. Detects both JSX usage and renamed-import paths (`Card as Surface`).
  - **Hand-rolled patterns** — `space-y-*` chains (≥3 per file), breakpoint `grid-cols-*` variants, dashed empty-state divs, hand-rolled `<ol>` timelines, `rounded-full border text-xs` badge spans. Severity `info` only — never fails the gate.

  Reuses a shared `walkSourceFiles` helper that skips heavy dirs (`node_modules`/`dist`/`build`/`out`/`coverage`/`target`) plus any dotfile dir blanket.

  **Studio discoverability**
  - `hex init` writes `studio: "https://hex-core.dev/studio"` into `hex.config.json`.
  - Post-init line: `Theme tweaking: hex-core.dev/studio — copy the payload back into your AI session.`

  **`@hex-core/mcp` wiring (opt-in)**

  `hex init --mcp` creates `.mcp.json` at the repo root (Claude Code's project-scope convention) or merges into `.cursor/mcp.json` / `.continue/config.json` when present. Read-merge-write — never clobbers existing `mcpServers` entries; reports `alreadyConfigured` when `hex-core` is already wired. Malformed JSON surfaces the file path so the user can fix it instead of being silently swallowed.

  Default OFF: `.mcp.json` is commit-tracked and auto-loaded, so the write requires explicit `--mcp` opt-in.

  **Skill discovery nudges**

  New `printSkillsHint()` helper detects `.claude/skills/hex-core-*/SKILL.md` and prints "ask your AI session to invoke the hex-core-overview skill". Wired into `add`, `init`, `recipe` (silent when no Hex Core skills present) and `skills` (always — the skills were just placed).

  **`app-shell` recipe**

  New `hex recipe add app-shell` starter bundles 12 foundation primitives (`container`, `stack`, `cluster`, `grid`, `spacer`, `empty`, `card`, `separator`, `badge`, `tag`, `timeline`, `breadcrumb`) with a checklist that nudges composition over hand-rolled utility chains. Recipe count goes from 13 to 14.

  **Tests**

  24 new unit tests across `post-install`, `mcp-config`, `walk-sources`, plus extensions to `add`, `doctor`, and `init`. CLI test suite: 265/265 pass.

### Patch Changes

- 62bcd13: feat(blocks): blocks tier + complete password-auth journey end-to-end

  Introduces **blocks** as a third tier above primitives and components — page-level compositions (sign-in pages, landing heroes, app shells) that share the registry, schema convention, and `hex add` install surface. Ships the foundation plus the **full password-auth journey** (sign-up → verify-email → sign-in → forgot → reset → sign-in, plus an OTP path for sign-in / verify-email / MFA) wired end-to-end through every layer of the pipeline.

  **`@hex-core/components` — new exports:**

  Pluggable adapter contract:
  - `AuthAdapter`, `AuthAdapterResult`, `AuthOtpIntent`, `AuthSocialProvider` — every auth block consumes the adapter via its `adapter` prop. Hex Core ships no session management; the adapter routes credential / OAuth / OTP handoffs to whatever the consumer wires up (better-auth, Clerk, NextAuth, Supabase Auth, custom server). Every method is optional so consumers can ship password-only on day one and add passkeys / OTP later without forking block source.
  - `mockAuthAdapter` — in-memory reference adapter for showcase routes and tests. Every method delays 400ms and resolves `{ ok: true }`. Never ship in production.

  Six auth blocks composing the password journey:
  - `AuthSignInSplit` — split-screen sign-in (marketing left, credential form right) with email + password, remember-me, optional social, forgot-password link.
  - `AuthSignUpCard` — centered-card sign-up with name (optional) + email + password (with confirm) + terms checkbox + optional social. Manual validation: email regex, password length, confirm-match, terms.
  - `AuthForgotPassword` — single-field form that swaps to an `Empty`-based "check your inbox" confirmation state on success.
  - `AuthResetPassword` — token-driven new-password + confirm form. Reads the opaque token from a prop (typically `?token=…` searchParam).
  - `AuthVerifyEmail` — transactional waiting page with optional resend cooldown. Resend button hides automatically when `adapter.resendMagicLink` is absent.
  - `AuthVerifyOtp` — N-digit (default 6) auto-submitting code input. Drives the heading and adapter routing from the `intent` prop (`"sign-in" | "verify-email" | "mfa"`).

  Two new optional methods on `AuthAdapter` (additive — no breaking change):
  - `resendMagicLink?(p: { email })` — distinct from `sendMagicLink` so consumers can throttle resends and surface separate analytics / error copy.
  - `resendOtp?(p: { intent })` — distinct from the initial code dispatch for the same reason.

  Every block: `.tsx` source + co-located `.schema.ts` (machine-readable AI hints, common mistakes, accessibility notes, token budget) + behavioral test (Testing Library + userEvent + warnSpy). Every block falls back to a generic user-facing error message and a structured `console.warn` when an adapter method is unimplemented.

  **`@hex-core/cli` — `rewrite-imports` fix for cross-tree block imports:**

  The legacy regex matched sibling-component imports (`../<name>/<name>`) and primitives (`../../primitives/<name>/<name>`) but not the cross-tree shape blocks need: a block at `blocks/<slug>/<slug>.tsx` reaches into `components/` two segments deep. `npx hex add auth-sign-in-split` (and any other auth block) now rewrites `../../components/alert/alert` to `@/components/ui/alert` correctly. Covered by a unit test.

  **Pipeline coverage shipped in this release:**
  - 6 block items in `registry/items/` + 6 auth recipes in `registry/recipes/` (5 new + the deprecated `auth-form` superseded by `auth-sign-in`)
  - 6 live demos + 6 showcase route pairs (`/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/verify-email`, `/verify-otp`) — each pair is a server component owning `metadata` + a `"use client"` wrapper owning the adapter binding
  - Concept doc at `/docs/blocks` with embedded live preview + install commands + a "Password-auth journey" gallery linking every showcase route
  - MCP contract test asserts the journey: `search_components({ category: "block" })` returns ≥6 blocks containing every expected slug; `get_component("auth-sign-in-split")` round-trips with required `adapter` prop and bundled `components/_shared/auth-adapter.tsx` source
  - 41 new behavioral tests across the 6 blocks (form submit, error display, social click, auto-submit-when-full for OTP, resend cooldown, unimplemented-method fallback, …)
  - A11y audit clean on every showcase route in light + dark
  - Visual regression baselines committed for every block (light + dark)
  - `hex add auth-sign-up-card` smoked end-to-end against a temp project; imports rewrite to `@/`-aliased paths; `_shared/auth-adapter.tsx` ships once
  - `hex recipe add auth-sign-up` smoked: 9 ordered steps + checklist printed
  - `auth-form` recipe is deprecated in favor of `auth-sign-in` (retained for back-compat with deprecation note in title + summary)

  No breaking changes. Tree-shake-safe — consumers only pay for what they install.

### Minor Changes

- 870fbcc: chore: rebrand "Hex UI" → "Hex Core" across the published surface

  Project name aligns with the `@hex-core/*` npm scope, the `hex-core` GitHub repo, and `hex-core.dev` domain. User-facing strings, package descriptions, READMEs, MCP server name + bin, skill directory naming, payload output headers, and the registry top-level name all switch from `Hex UI` / `hex-ui` → `Hex Core` / `hex-core`.

  **Migration for existing consumers:**
  - `hex-ui-mcp` binary renamed to `hex-core-mcp`. If you have a shell alias or script that calls `hex-ui-mcp` directly, update it. The canonical `npx -y @hex-core/mcp` invocation is unchanged.
  - Bundled skill directories renamed `skills/hex-ui-*` → `skills/hex-core-*`. Re-run `npx @hex-core/cli skills install --overwrite` to migrate `.claude/skills/hex-ui-*` to the new names. The CLI's skill detector now looks for the `hex-core-` prefix only.
  - Docs site `localStorage` theme key renamed from `hex-ui-theme` to `hex-core-theme`; users will see the system-default theme on first reload after upgrade.
  - MCP server's handshake `name` is now `hex-core` (was `hex-ui`). Clients connect by stdio command, not by name lookup, so this is informational only.
  - Recommended MCP config key in docs is now `"hex-core"`. Existing configs keyed `"hex-ui"` keep working — the key is a user-chosen label.

  Output formats: `emit_app_context` headers are now `# App context — Hex Core`, `emit_figma_tokens` collection naming is `Hex Core — <theme>`. Anything snapshotting these strings should refresh.

  No public TypeScript API surface changed.

- dc54d07: feat(cli): `hex migrate` — convert Next.js / Vite / CRA / CRACO + shadcn/ui projects to Hex Core in-place

  Detects the host framework + shadcn footprint, replaces each `<components>/ui/*.tsx` with the matching Hex Core source at the same alias-resolved path, installs missing peer deps via the consumer's package manager (npm / pnpm / yarn / bun — auto-detected), and writes a `*.shadcn.bak` next to each converted file so the original survives for diff/restore.

  **What it migrates (file-replace strategy)**
  - 36 of 40 canonical shadcn slugs (button, dialog, dropdown-menu, form, …) map 1:1 by name.
  - `toast` → `sonner` (rename — Hex Core ships only the Sonner wrapper). The original `toast.tsx` is backed up and removed.
  - `carousel` and `chart` are skipped with a warning — no Hex Core equivalent yet.

  **Framework detection**

  Recognizes Next.js (App Router and Pages Router, with or without `--src-dir`), Vite + React, Create React App, and CRACO. The framework drives the Toaster mount hint in the report (e.g. `src/app/layout.tsx` for Next.js App Router, `src/main.tsx` for Vite).

  **Flag set**

  ```
  hex migrate [--dry-run] [--yes] [--no-backup] [--no-install]
              [--from <dir>] [--theme=preserve|replace]
              [--only <slugs>]
  ```

  - `--dry-run` plans without writing or spawning.
  - `--theme=replace` swaps the consumer's `globals.css` palette via the existing `theme apply` machinery (surgical — preserves custom rules).
  - `--only <slugs>` restricts the migration to a comma-list of shadcn slugs.

  **Doctor extension**

  `hex doctor` now flags leftover shadcn artifacts (`components.json`, `toast.tsx`, `hooks/use-toast.ts`) with a `warn` and points the user at `hex migrate`. Idempotent: a re-run on a successfully-migrated project finds no signal and exits cleanly.

  **Out of scope (future)**
  - v2 will add npm-imported libraries (MUI, Chakra, Mantine, NextUI) via codemod + `hex add` + `npm uninstall`.
  - v3 will add CSS-class libraries (Bootstrap, DaisyUI) via className rewriting.
  - Heavy-modification detection (`shadcn-baselines.json` + Levenshtein heuristic) — v1 always backs up + overwrites.

### Minor Changes

- d67fa60: feat(ai): 5 new AI Elements components + CLI heavy-peer prompt

  Closes the AI Elements parity gap from 13/40 → 18/40 by adding the Code, Voice, and Workflow categories. Each component is a thin headless wrapper around an opt-in engine declared as a heavy peer dep.

  **New components (`@hex-core/components`):**
  - **`Terminal`** — xterm.js wrapper. Headless data flow: pass `output` (diffed against prior render), receive typed bytes via `onInput`. Peer: `@xterm/xterm@^5.5.0` (~150 KB gzip).
  - **`Canvas`** — reactflow node-graph canvas for agent workflows / RAG document graphs. Default Background + Controls; slot for MiniMap and Panels. Peer: `reactflow@^11.11.0` (~80 KB gzip).
  - **`AudioPlayer`** — wavesurfer.js playback control with play/pause + waveform progress + duration. Peer: `wavesurfer.js@^7.8.0` (~50 KB gzip, shared with AudioWaveform).
  - **`AudioWaveform`** — standalone non-interactive waveform display for voice-message previews and recording indicators. Peer: `wavesurfer.js@^7.8.0`.
  - **`Diagram`** — Mermaid renderer for AI-emitted flowcharts / sequence / class diagrams. Engine sanitizes SVG via `securityLevel: "strict"`. Peer: `mermaid@^11.0.0` (~700 KB gzip).

  **CLI heavy-peer flow (`@hex-core/cli`):**

  `hex add <component>` now detects heavy peer deps declared in the registry and prompts before installing. Single batched UX for multi-component installs:

  ```
  This sprint installs 2 components with heavy peer dependencies:

    → @xterm/xterm@^5.5.0  (~150 KB gzip)  for terminal
       Renders the terminal grid + handles input/output
    → mermaid@^11.0.0      (~700 KB gzip)  for diagram

    Total: ~850 KB gzip added to your bundle.

  Install now? [Y/n]:
  ```

  `--yes` skips the prompt. `--no-install` prints the manual install command. Decline keeps the component source on disk so you can install the peer later.

  **Schema (`@hex-core/registry`):**

  New `dependencies.heavyPeer` array on `dependencySchema`: `{ name, version, bundleKbGzip?, reason? }[]`. Optional — existing schema files don't need changes.

  All 5 components ship as optional peers in `@hex-core/components/package.json` (peerDependenciesMeta.optional: true), mirroring the existing pattern for vaul/sonner/cmdk.

- d09d07c: feat(cli): tsconfig-aware alias resolver, `theme add --from <studio-url>`, granular `--overwrite`, doctor drift check, `--dry-run`, manifest add

  Closes the @hex-core/cli@0.4.0 feedback (P0 alias-resolution bug + Studio integration). Single PR covers every item in the review.

  **Bug fixes:**
  - **`hex add` honors `tsconfig.json#paths` and `--src-dir` Next.js layout.** A new resolver (`packages/cli/src/lib/resolve-alias.ts`) consults `tsconfig.json#compilerOptions.paths["@/*"]` (with `extends`-chain support) first, falls back to a `src/` heuristic, and finally to cwd-relative. Components and lib utilities now land where the project's import system expects them — no more `mv components src/components` after every install.
  - **`hex doctor` warns on alias drift.** When components live at `<cwd>/components/ui` but the resolver expects `<cwd>/src/components/ui` (or vice-versa), doctor surfaces the exact `mv` command to fix it.
  - **`hex init` detects `src/` layout** and prints `Detected src/ layout — components will be written under src/components/.` so the user knows where future writes go.
  - **`hex recipe add <slug>` no longer fails typecheck** (was missing `install` on the AddOptions spread). Now passes `install: true` explicitly so peer deps are resolved end-to-end.
  - **TS export identifier sanitization** in `renderThemeAsTs`. Kebab-case slugs (`midnight-custom`) now emit `export const midnightCustomTheme` instead of the invalid `export const midnight-customTheme`.

  **New features:**
  - **`hex theme add <slug> --from <studio-url>`** — compose a custom theme from a Hex Core Studio URL and write it as TypeScript. Parses `?base=<preset>&radius=<rem>&<token>_<mode>=<HSL-triplet>` params, applies via `extendTheme`, serializes through `renderTheme(..., "ts")`, writes to `src/themes/<slug>.ts` (or `themes/<slug>.ts`).
  - **`hex add --dry-run`** — plan but do not write files or run installs. Prints `Would write:` for every file that would be created plus a per-run summary.
  - **`hex add --from <manifest>`** — install every slug from a `hex.components.json`-style file (`{ "components": ["button", "card"] }`). Errors if mixed with positional args.
  - **`hex init --overwrite=globals.css,tailwind.config.ts`** — granular file replacement. Bare `--overwrite` still means "all" for backwards compat.
  - **`hex init --check`** — runs the doctor inline and exits non-zero on drift. CI / pre-commit safe.
  - **`hex recipe list` and `hex recipe --help`** — recipe listing surfaced.

  **Polish:**
  - Resolved paths in every `Write:` log line (was the raw registry path).
  - Color output via `picocolors` (already a dep). Respects `NO_COLOR` and TTY detection.
  - TTY-aware install spinner during peer-dep resolution.

  **Migration for `--src-dir` users on 0.4.0:**

  If you ran `hex add` on 0.4.0 in a `pnpm create next-app --src-dir` project, your components are at `<cwd>/components/ui/` instead of `<cwd>/src/components/ui/`. Run `hex doctor` — the drift warning prints the exact `mv` command. After moving, future `hex add` invocations land in the correct directory automatically.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d11f7b5: feat(cli): interactive `hex theme edit -i`

  Closes the UX asymmetry between `theme init` and `theme edit`: until now
  `init` had both flag-driven (`--preset`) and interactive (`-i`) modes,
  but `edit` only had flag-driven (`--token key=value`). Humans tweaking
  a single token had to memorize the HSL-triplet syntax and the contrast
  implications upfront.

  The new `-i` mode walks every token in the file:
  - **Categorize** — picks "Color" / "Radius" / "Other" with counts;
    empty categories are hidden so a file with no `--radius` block
    doesn't surface that branch.
  - **Pick a token** — shows the current value as an inline ANSI swatch
    for color tokens (24-bit truecolor, falls back to a labeled hex on
    `NO_COLOR` or unsupported terminals).
  - **Mode** — `light` / `dark` / `both`, defaulting to `both`. Skipped
    when the file has only a `:root` block.
  - **New value** — accepts hex (`#1e293b`), CSS `hsl()`, named colors,
    or raw HSL triplets for color tokens. Loops on parse failure.
  - **AA contrast gate** — for foreground-paired tokens (`primary-foreground`
    vs `primary`, etc.) re-checks contrast against the relevant background.
    Sub-AA pairs surface a warning + retry/accept prompt that mirrors the
    existing `init -i` `promptSurfaceWithContrastGate` UX.
  - **Buffered writes** — overrides are queued in memory and flushed once
    on exit, so a Ctrl-C mid-flow leaves the file untouched.

  The flag-driven `--token key=value` path is unchanged. All shared logic
  (`applyTokenOverride`, `colorInputToTokenValue`, `contrastRatio`,
  `swatch`) is reused — no duplication. New parser lives at
  `packages/cli/src/lib/parse-globals.ts` and round-trips with the
  existing edit/replace pipeline.

### Patch Changes

- 39a5c92: fix(cli): ship sibling/shared variants files, read version from package.json, surface broken internal deps

  `@hex-core/cli@0.3.1` had three issues a fresh-project user hit on day one. This patch addresses all of them and adds a verification sweep so the same class of bug stops slipping through.

  **`@hex-core/cli`** (patch):
  - **`hex add button` now compiles.** Previously the CLI wrote `button.tsx` but not its sibling `button-variants.tsx`, so consumer projects failed with `Module not found: Can't resolve './button-variants'`. The registry build now auto-discovers sibling `*-variants.{ts,tsx}` files, cross-package variants imports (e.g. `pagination → button-variants`), and `_shared/*` files referenced by component sources, and bundles them into each registry manifest. Five components were affected: `button`, `pagination`, `grid`, `cluster`, `stack`.
  - **`hex --version` now reports the real version.** The flag was hardcoded to `"0.1.0"` and had drifted across six releases. The CLI now reads `version` from its own `package.json` at runtime via `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`, so the printed version always matches the installed package.
  - **Broken internal deps now warn instead of silently dropping.** `internalDepToSlug` accepts only the 3-segment path form (`primitives/<slug>/<slug>`); bare slugs returned `null` and were silently skipped, leaving `loading → skeleton`, `toggle-group → toggle`, and `form → label` with unresolvable imports. Those three schemas are now corrected, and `installOne` prints a visible warning when it sees a malformed dep so future authoring drift surfaces immediately.
  - **Import rewriter** gained two rules for sibling-variants paths (`./button-variants` and `../../primitives/<dir>/<dir>-variants`), with six new unit tests covering the patterns.
  - **README**: the unscoped-`hex-core` collision warning is promoted above Quickstart and reformatted as a `> [!WARNING]` GitHub admonition so first-time readers can't miss it.

  **`@hex-core/components`** (patch):
  - `loading.schema.ts`, `toggle-group.schema.ts`, `form.schema.ts` updated to use the canonical `primitives/<slug>/<slug>` form for internal deps, matching the convention already used by `data-table`.

  **`@hex-core/registry`** (patch):
  - All 77 component manifests regenerated. New `verify-add-all.ts` script runs `hex add <slug>` against every component in an isolated temp dir and asserts each `@/...` import resolves to a written file — caught the three bare-slug regressions above and is now part of the toolkit for future releases.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f53d79: feat(themes): 71 brand-derived theme presets (Tesla, Stripe, Linear, …)

  Imports the full
  [voltagent/awesome-design-md](https://github.com/voltagent/awesome-design-md)
  catalog (MIT-licensed, distributed via `getdesign`) as ready-to-use
  theme presets. Studio's preset switcher now has 74 themes available
  out of the box (3 first-party + 71 brand-derived).

  **`@hex-core/themes`** (minor):
  - 71 new presets at `packages/themes/src/presets/<slug>.ts`, one per
    brand. Spans 9 categories: AI/LLM, dev-tools, backend, productivity,
    design, fintech, e-commerce, media, automotive.
  - Each preset carries a full WCAG-AA-validated light + dark token set,
    plus brand metadata (`brand`, `category`, `tags`, `attribution`) and
    the verbatim source markdown brief as `designBrief` — so LLM agents
    reading the `Copy for LLM` payload get typography + motion +
    composition guidance alongside the tokens.
  - `searchThemes({ category, tags, query })` filters the catalog by any
    combination of those axes.
  - `extendTheme(base, overrides)` composes a new theme from a preset
    with user-provided token overrides (deep-merged + re-validated via
    `strictThemeSchema`).
  - `presetsByCategory` and `presetSlugs` indexes for category-aware UIs.
  - Per-preset deep imports: `@hex-core/themes/presets/tesla` resolves
    to a 28KB chunk; the full barrel is 1.6MB. Tree-shake at will.

  **`@hex-core/registry`** (patch):
  - `themeSchema` gains optional `brand` / `category` / `tags` /
    `designBrief` / `attribution` fields. All-optional so existing
    themes (`default`, `midnight`, `ember`) pass unchanged.
  - New `themeCategorySchema` enum (9 categories) and
    `themeAttributionSchema` for provenance metadata.

  **`@hex-core/tokens`** (patch):
  - New `buildTokenSet(seeds, mode)` helper extracted from the CLI's
    interactive flow. Both the CLI and the new `import-voltagent`
    script share a single source of truth for "build a complete
    TokenSet from 5 seed values."

  **`@hex-core/payload`** (patch):
  - `listThemes()` / `getTheme()` / `themes` now return the merged
    catalog (OSS + voltagent presets), so Studio's `/studio/copy` LLM
    payload sees every preset.
  - `AppContextTheme` carries the new metadata; `buildAppContext`
    emits a `## Design brief` block when present, plus a `brand /
category / tags` line and an attribution footer.

  **`@hex-core/mcp`** (patch):
  - New `search_themes` tool — filter the catalog by `category`,
    `tags`, and/or free-text `query`. Returns the same shape as
    `list_themes`, filtered.
  - `list_themes` description updated to mention the 71 brand presets.

  **`@hex-core/cli`** (patch):
  - `hex theme list` lists every preset grouped by category, with
    `--category` / `--tag` / `--json` filters.
  - `hex theme init --preset <slug>` — alias for `--name` that
    reads more naturally; works against any of the 74 presets.
  - `hex theme apply <slug>` likewise accepts any preset.

  **Reproducibility** — `pnpm import:themes:fetch` vendors the briefs from
  `getdesign@latest` (or a pinned version) into `.cache/getdesign-templates/`
  via `npm pack`. `pnpm import:themes` then deterministically regenerates
  every preset (no API calls). Per-preset extraction outcomes — including
  low-confidence picks that warrant manual review — are logged to
  `.context/voltagent-import.md`.

  **Visual baselines** — refreshes 6 dark-mode snapshots (`button`,
  `data-table`, `form`, `progress`, `slider`, `tabs`). These catch up with
  the destructive-foreground darkening landed in the prior a11y PR — they
  weren't pixel-refreshed at the time. No new visual diffs introduced by
  this PR's code paths.

  **Attribution** — each generated preset file carries a header
  linking to the upstream MIT-licensed source; the full LICENSE text
  is preserved at `LICENSES/voltagent-MIT.md`. Brand presets are
  _style references inspired by publicly visible design systems_,
  not endorsements.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2bdd746: feat(tokens,cli): interactive theme authoring + shared color-math primitives

  Phase 1 of the theme-authoring system. The CLI gains `hex theme init -i` —
  an interactive flow that walks the user through a small set of seed colors
  (primary, foreground, background, destructive, radius), derives the rest
  of the canonical token slots automatically, validates through
  `strictThemeSchema`, and writes the result as CSS, JSON, or a TS theme
  file ready to drop into `@hex-core/tokens`.

  ### `@hex-core/tokens`

  New pure-function color-math helpers exported from the package root:
  - **`deriveForegroundFor(bgValue)`** — pick near-white or near-black for
    WCAG-AA contrast against any background. Used to auto-pair every
    `*-foreground` slot with its base.
  - **`deriveDarkFromLight(tokenSet)`** — mirror a light TokenSet into a
    coherent dark TokenSet by inverting lightness around 50% while
    preserving hue and reducing saturation 25% (avoids the neon-toxic
    effect of naive HSL inversion).
  - **`deriveSecondaryFromPrimary(primary)`** — desaturate + lighten a
    primary into the muted-but-related fill that Cancel/Save-Draft buttons
    pair with.
  - **`contrastRatio(fg, bg)`** — WCAG-conformant contrast computation
    exposed for authoring-time gates.
  - **`colorInputToTokenValue(input)`** — parse anything culori accepts
    (hex, named colors, `hsl()`, `rgb()`) into the canonical
    `"<H> <S>% <L>%"` token-value string.
  - **`tokenLuminance(value)`** — the perceptual brightness of a color,
    for callers picking shimmer / overlay tints dynamically.

  These helpers live in `@hex-core/tokens` (not `@hex-core/cli`) so the
  future Hex Studio web UI in `hex-ui-platform` can reuse them in its
  React sliders without bundling commander + @inquirer/prompts. Both
  shells (terminal CLI + web Studio) wrap the same color math.

  ### `@hex-core/cli`
  - **`hex theme init -i`** — interactive flow described above. Renders
    ANSI swatches inline so authors can see what they're picking; gracefully
    falls back to bare hex strings when `NO_COLOR` is set or the terminal
    doesn't support 24-bit color.
  - **`--format ts`** — new output format that writes a TS theme file
    matching the shape of `packages/tokens/src/themes/{default,midnight,ember}.ts`.
    Used to dogfood-author a new opinionated default theme to replace the
    current shadcn-clone palette (Phase 2, follow-up).
  - **`hex theme init` (non-interactive)** — unchanged. Existing
    `--name <preset>` / `--out <path>` flags keep working for scripted
    scaffolding from the OSS preset themes.
  - **`hex theme edit`, `hex theme apply`** — unchanged.

  ### New deps
  - `culori@latest` — color manipulation (HSL parsing, WCAG contrast,
    freeform color-string parsing). Added to both `@hex-core/tokens`
    (runtime, for the derive helpers) and `@hex-core/cli` (re-uses the
    same parser for prompt input).
  - `@inquirer/prompts@latest` — terminal prompts (CLI only).
  - `picocolors@latest` — ANSI output (CLI only).

  ### Migration

  None for non-interactive consumers. The new flag is opt-in:
  `hex theme init -i` triggers the new path; bare `hex theme init`
  preserves v0.2.x behavior.

  ### What's next

  Phase 2 (separate PR): run `hex theme init -i --format ts --out
packages/tokens/src/themes/default.ts --overwrite` to author the new
  opinionated default theme that replaces the shadcn-clone palette
  flagged in `.claude/research/phase-2-feedback.md` (F2-06).

  Backfill changeset for PR #92 (commit `c967659`, merged 2026-04-28). PR #92 shipped 7 fixes after a real POC against `cli@0.2.2` but never landed a changeset, leaving the cli stuck on main without a release path.

### Patch Changes

- d99548a: fix(cli): bundle registry into npm tarball + rewrite imports to alias paths

  Resolves the post-init install wall: `hex add` now writes import-correct files into
  the consumer's `components/ui/` directory (alias-rewritten, no `.js` suffixes). The
  registry tarball-bundled `prebuild` step lets `hex list` / `hex add` work outside
  the monorepo. `hex doctor` reports install invariants (Tailwind major, peer deps,
  hex.config.json, lib/utils, globals.css shape).

  Backfill changeset for PR #88 (`fix: collapse the post-init install wall…`,
  commit `0729f38`) — the PR shipped the fixes but no changeset, so cli has been
  sitting on main without a release path.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c8a4d52: Fix: published tarballs now correctly pin workspace dependencies.

  Previous releases of `@hex-core/components`, `@hex-core/cli`, and `@hex-core/mcp` shipped `"@hex-core/registry": "workspace:^"` literal in the tarball's `dependencies`, breaking every consumer outside a pnpm workspace with `npm error code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`. `@hex-core/tokens` shipped a similar literal for its registry dependency.

  Root cause: `scripts/publish-local.sh` used `npm publish`, which uploads tarballs as-is. Switched to `pnpm publish`, which rewrites `workspace:^` → pinned `^X.Y.Z` automatically.

  `@hex-core/registry` has no workspace dependencies and was not affected, but is bumped to keep the family in lockstep and simplify the release narrative.

  After this release, `npm install @hex-core/components` (and the other published packages) succeeds in any consumer project regardless of package manager.

- 6c8c141: Theme A — WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance.

  Major bump on `@hex-core/components` and `@hex-core/tokens` — there are user-observable behavior and visual changes (see Migration). Everything else is additive or covered by the audit gate.

  ### Migration
  - **Dark `--destructive` lightened, `--destructive-foreground` flipped to dark** across all three theme presets (default / midnight / ember). Required so destructive surfaces and destructive text both pass WCAG 2.2 AA in dark mode. Visual diff: previously a deep red (`hsl(0 62% 30%)`) with white text, now a coral red (`hsl(0 75% 65%)`) with dark text (`hsl(0 75% 15%)`). Consumers who painted `--destructive-foreground` on a _non-destructive_ surface in dark mode (uncommon — most use it inside destructive buttons / alerts) will see dark text instead of white and need to point those surfaces at `--foreground` instead.
  - **`ScrollArea` viewport is now keyboard-focusable by default** (`viewportTabIndex={0}`). Apps that wrap purely decorative content in ScrollArea will see a new tab stop. Pass `viewportTabIndex={-1}` to opt out — the prop is the new opt-out surface and is documented in `scroll-area.schema.ts`.
  - **`CommandSeparator` is no longer the cmdk primitive.** It now renders as `<div role="none" data-cmdk-separator="">` so it can sit inside `CommandList` (`role="listbox"`) without violating ARIA's required-children rule. The `data-cmdk-separator` attribute is preserved for selector compatibility, but anyone reading cmdk's _internal_ Separator state (rare) will need to update.
  - **`DataTable` accessible label prop renamed `ariaLabel` → `aria-label`** (kebab-case quoted prop) to match the convention used elsewhere in Hex UI. This was introduced earlier in the same PR cycle and never shipped publicly, but call it out for anyone tracking pre-release branches.
  - **`Dialog` overflow handling now uses an inner scroll container** (`scrollable={true}` is the default). Long content scrolls inside the focus trap; the close button stays anchored to the (non-scrolling) outer panel. Consumers who previously relied on DialogContent itself being the scroll container (custom `overflow-*` className overrides) should pass `scrollable={false}` and manage scroll themselves — `CommandDialog` does this internally.

  ### Additive changes

  `@hex-core/components`
  - `Combobox`: new `aria-labelledby` prop. Trigger now wires `aria-controls` to a `useId`-stable id pointing at `CommandList`, gated on `open` so it's only set when the listbox is actually mounted.
  - `DataTable`: new `caption?: ReactNode` and `aria-label?: string` props. Previously the table shipped without a caption, leaving screen-reader users without context.
  - `DialogContent`: new `scrollable?: boolean` prop (default `true`). See Migration.
  - `Slider`: new `thumbLabels?: string[]` prop for per-thumb names. Single-thumb sliders auto-mirror the Root's `aria-label`; range sliders fall back to indexed `(N of M)` names if no `thumbLabels` is provided. A dev-mode warning fires when `thumbLabels.length !== value.length`.
  - `ScrollArea`: new `viewportTabIndex?: number` prop. See Migration.
  - `CommandSeparator`: rendered as a presentational div. See Migration.
  - `TableCaption`: now sets `caption-bottom` so the `<caption>` element sits below the table visually while remaining first in document order (announced first by screen readers).

  `@hex-core/tokens`
  - Light `--muted-foreground` tightened to ≥4.5:1 across all three themes.
  - Light `--destructive` darkened so destructive button text passes 4.5:1.
  - Dark destructive flip — see Migration.

  ### Repo
  - New `pnpm run a11y-audit` boots the docs prod build and runs axe-core (`@axe-core/playwright`) against every component demo in light + dark. Fails on critical/serious violations. Wired into CI; report uploaded as a workflow artifact. Hardened against banner-string drift, port collisions, and SIGTERM cancellation.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains an Accessibility section covering form-control labelling, contrast budget, composite-widget rules, and dialog overflow guidance.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 07bea53: Theme B substrate — full custom-tokens surface across the OS.

  **`@hex-core/tokens`** now ships beyond color + radius:
  - Spacing scale (`--space-1` through `--space-16`)
  - Gap presets (`--gap-sm/md/lg`)
  - Control heights (`--control-height-sm/md/lg`)
  - Typography scale (`--text-xs` through `--text-3xl`)
  - Motion duration tokens (`--duration-fast/normal/slow`)

  Shared across the 3 theme presets via `themes/shared.ts`. `themeToTailwindConfig`
  now emits `spacing`, `fontSize`, `transitionDuration`, and `height` maps in
  addition to `colors` and `borderRadius`, so consumers wire the whole token set
  into Tailwind's `theme.extend` in one call.

  **`@hex-core/components`** — all 47 components migrated to read tokens via
  CSS-variable references. Fallbacks match prior Tailwind defaults, so consumers
  without a theme loaded see zero visual change. Override `--space-6` (etc.) in
  your `globals.css` and every component reflows.

  **`@hex-core/registry`** — adds `tokenSetSchema`, `strictTokenSetSchema`,
  `strictThemeSchema`, plus `REQUIRED_COLOR_TOKENS` and `REQUIRED_RADIUS_TOKENS`
  constants. Strict variants validate that a theme defines the 19 color tokens +
  radius needed for components to render correctly. Existing `themeSchema` stays
  loose for runtime parsing.

  **`@hex-core/cli`** — adds `hex theme init` and `hex theme edit`:

  ```bash
  # scaffold globals.css from a preset (full token block, light + dark)
  pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli theme init --name midnight --out app/globals.css

  # override one or more tokens, scoped or both
  pnpm dlx @hex-core/cli theme edit \
    --file app/globals.css \
    --token "primary=240 50% 50%"
  ```

  114 unit tests cover the new surface (was 65 before).
