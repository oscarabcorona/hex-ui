 *      (prebuild step copies the repo-root `skills/` into `packages/cli/skills/`).
 *      From `packages/cli/dist/<chunk>.js`, that's `../skills`.
 *   2. Dev via `tsx` from `packages/cli/src/lib/skills-dir.ts`: the repo-root
 *      `skills/` lives 4 dirs up (repo → packages → cli → src → lib).
 *   3. Fallback: cwd-relative for users running from the repo root.
 *
 * Every candidate is additionally required to contain at least one
 * `hex-ui-*\/SKILL.md`, so an unrelated `skills/` directory at a parent
 * path can't masquerade as the bundled pack.
 * @returns Absolute path to the skills dir, or null if not found
