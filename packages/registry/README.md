Zod schemas + TypeScript types for the Hex Core component registry.

This package is the **shared contract** between `@hex-core/components`, `@hex-core/cli`, and `@hex-core/mcp`. It doesn't ship runtime UI — it's schemas describing what a component is (props, variants, examples, AI hints).

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @hex-core/registry
```

## Usage

```ts
import { RegistryItemSchema, type RegistryItem } from "@hex-core/registry/schema";

const result = RegistryItemSchema.safeParse(json);
if (result.success) {
  const item: RegistryItem = result.data;
  // …
}
```

## Intent metadata (0.4.0+)

The schemas describe **shape** AND **intent** so LLMs can pick the right component without guessing from training-data heuristics.

### Per-variant `useWhen`

```ts
{ value: "destructive",
  description: "Red button with shadow for dangerous actions",
  useWhen: "irreversible actions: delete, archive, deactivate, leave, force-quit" }
```

### Structured anti-patterns

`aiHintSchema.antiPatterns` complements the free-form `commonMistakes` with a typed channel that names a registry slug to redirect to:

```ts
{ mistake: "Using a Slider with min=0/max=1 to represent on/off",
  insteadUse: "switch",
  why: "Slider semantics are 'continuous range' — assistive tech announces step values, not on/off." }
```

The `insteadUse` field MUST be a registry slug, so `@hex-core/mcp`'s `describe_intent` tool can follow the link and return the suggested alternative as a real registry entry rather than free text.

### Composition-tagged examples

`usageExampleSchema.composition?: string[]` tags the surrounding context an example demonstrates (`["dialog", "destructive", "confirm"]`, `["form", "form-action"]`). MCP's `search_compositions` ranks examples by tag overlap so a query like `["destructive", "confirm"]` returns the canonical AlertDialog-with-delete-Button example instead of a bare `<Button variant="destructive">`.

### Semantic tokens

`semanticTokenSetSchema` (paired with `defaultSemanticTokens` in `@hex-core/tokens`) is the intent layer over raw tokens:

```ts
"button.destructive.bg": {
  value: "{color.destructive}",
  useWhen: "irreversible actions",
  type: "color"
}
```

LLMs asked "what's the right token for a delete button background" reach for `button.destructive.bg` instead of guessing `bg-red-500`.

## shadcn projection (0.9.0+)

`toShadcnRegistryItem` projects any Hex registry item into the [shadcn registry-item](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-item-json) wire format, and `shadcnRegistryItemSchema` validates the result. Category maps to `type` (`registry:ui` / `registry:block` / `registry:hook` / …), `heavyPeer` folds into `dependencies`, `cssVariables` pivots to `cssVars.light` / `cssVars.dark`, and the `ai` block rides along verbatim so agents reading the installed project keep the intent metadata.

```ts
import { toShadcnRegistryItem, shadcnRegistryItemSchema } from "@hex-core/registry";
import { rewriteRegistryImports } from "@hex-core/payload";

const wire = toShadcnRegistryItem(item, {
  // Required when serving shadcn consumers: rewrites the monorepo-relative
  // import specifiers the shadcn CLI never touches (it only rewrites `@/`).
  transformFileContent: (content) => rewriteRegistryImports(content),
  // Optional: resolve `dependencies.internal` so their npm deps are unioned in.
  resolveInternalItem: (slug) => registry.get(slug) ?? null,
});
shadcnRegistryItemSchema.parse(wire); // throws if the projection drifted
```

This is what the docs site serves at `/r/{name}.json`. Declare it once in `components.json` — `{ "registries": { "@hex": "https://hex-core.dev/r/{name}.json" } }` — and `npx shadcn@latest add @hex/button` installs from the `@hex` namespace.

## Render targets (0.10.0+)

Every item carries a `platform` of `"web"` or `"native"`. It is optional on the authoring type and omitted from emitted JSON when it is `"web"`, so the existing catalog stays byte-identical — absence means web.

`deriveNativeSchema(webSchema, overrides)` builds a React Native schema from a web one plus an explicit diff, and is how `@hex-core/native` authors its 26 items:

```ts
import { deriveNativeSchema } from "@hex-core/registry";

export const nativeButtonSchema = deriveNativeSchema(buttonSchema, {
  removeProps: ["asChild"],
  addProps: [{ name: "onPress", type: "function", required: false, description: "…" }],
  dependencies: { npm: [...], internal: ["lib/utils"], peer: ["react", "react-native", "nativewind"] },
  examples: [...],
  ai: { commonMistakes: [...], relatedComponents: [...], accessibilityNotes: "…" },
});
```

`accessibilityNotes`, `commonMistakes`, `examples` and `dependencies` are **required** overrides rather than inherited — that is where DOM assumptions hide (`aria-label` on a `<button>`, a `hover:` example, a Radix dependency). `tokensUsed` and `tokenBudget` cannot be declared at all; the registry build measures both from the native source.

`resolveInternalDepForPlatform(dep, ownerPlatform, exists)` resolves a dependency against the platform of the item that declared it. Internal deps name a *source path* (`primitives/text/text`), which is identical in a native item and a web one, so resolving with `internalDepToSlug` alone points every native consumer at the React DOM component of the same name. Every reader of `dependencies.internal` must go through it.

## Notes

Most users of Hex Core never touch this package directly. If you're building a custom tool that reads the registry JSON (`registry/registry.json` in the repo, or `/registry.json` on the docs site — alongside `/recipes.json`, `/graph.json`, and `llms.txt`), this is your source of truth for the schema.
